# Game Concept: Neural Network Quest

## Story and Objective:
Your game starts at the input neuron. Your goal is to travel layer‐by‐layer through a simple feedforward network and reach a designated target output neuron with enough “activation energy” remaining. Along the way, you’ll choose which connections to follow. Each connection multiplies your current activation by its weight, and your activation level will be visualized by node color intensity. Choose wisely: if your activation falls below a set threshold at any point, your signal “dies” and the quest ends!

##Learning Moment:

After each round, the game displays the path you took, the weight multiplications along the way, and a short explanation of how weights and activations work in a neural network.
I will be adding more and more Neural netwrok concepts in the future updates!
