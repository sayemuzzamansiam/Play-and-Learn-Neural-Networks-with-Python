This project prove a simple gameplay system to understand Neural Network

# Game Concept: Neural Network Quest

## Story and Objective:
Your game starts at the input neuron. Your goal is to travel layer‐by‐layer through a simple feedforward network and reach a designated target output neuron with enough “activation energy” remaining. Along the way, you’ll choose which connections to follow. Each connection multiplies your current activation by its weight, and your activation level will be visualized by node color intensity. Choose wisely: if your activation falls below a set threshold at any point, your signal “dies” and the quest ends!
